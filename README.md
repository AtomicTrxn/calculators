# Calculators

A collection of self-contained browser calculators.

## Included calculators

- Group Expense Tracker: split shared costs by group, headcount, date ranges, and prior payments. Includes CSV import/export and two sharing modes: snapshot links (data encoded in the URL hash) and optional live cloud trackers (shared at a link anyone can edit, keeping the last 5 revisions).
- Retirement Planner: project savings year by year through retirement and run a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability the plan lasts. Models account types (taxable/traditional/Roth/HSA), taxes, RMDs, Social Security claiming, phased spending, itemized post-retirement expenses (per-line monthly/annual amounts, inflation treatment, and age windows), and healthcare/long-term care. Calculation logic lives in `retirement-engine.js`. See `docs/retirement-calculator-plan.md` and `docs/post-retirement-expense-builder-plan.md` for the designs.
- FIRE Calculator: three financial-independence numbers in today's dollars — the tax-aware FIRE number, the Coast FIRE amount needed today to stop saving, and years to FI on the current path. Retirement spending is a single amount or an itemized budget of monthly/annual line items. Calculation logic lives in `fire-engine.js`. See `docs/fire-calculator-plan.md` for the design.

## Retirement Planner (React)

`app/` is a standalone React rewrite of the Retirement Planner — same
underlying financial model, ported and typed rather than redesigned, but a
different frontend architecture (Vite + TypeScript strict mode, React Hook
Form + Zod, a Web Worker for the Monte Carlo simulation, Recharts, Tailwind +
Radix/shadcn). It runs entirely independently of the calculators above: its
own `package.json`, its own `localStorage` key, no shared plan, no build-step
dependency on anything at the repo root. See
[`docs/retirement-react-rewrite-plan.md`](docs/retirement-react-rewrite-plan.md)
for the full architecture writeup and the reasoning behind each pattern
choice.

```sh
cd app
npm install
npm run dev      # local dev server
npm test         # Vitest — engine parity, schema, hooks, reducer, forms
npm run build    # production build (GitHub Pages, see deploy workflow)
```

Calculator data can be shared in two ways. Snapshot links store data in the URL hash using a compact browser-readable format, with no server involvement — best for personal backup, one-off sharing, or static handoff. The Group Expense Tracker also supports live cloud tracker links, which store data server-side and are editable by anyone holding the link. Older compressed snapshot links from development builds still load in browsers that support built-in gzip decompression.

## Checks

Run these before committing page changes:

```sh
node scripts/check-links.js
node scripts/check-handlers.js
node scripts/retirement-tests.js
node scripts/cloud-client-tests.js
node scripts/fire-tests.js
```

`check-handlers.js` verifies that every inline `onclick`-style handler resolves
to a function that actually exists — with no build step, a mistyped handler
otherwise fails silently at runtime.

The optional cloud backend for the expense tracker lives in `worker/` (see
`worker/README.md` and `docs/cloud-tracker-plan.md`). Its suite needs no
install:

```sh
cd worker && npm test
```
